=== Description


This library allows communication with I2C/TWI devices. On the Arduino boards with the R3 layout (1.0 pinout), the SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line) are on the pin headers close to the AREF pin. The Arduino Due has two I2C/TWI interfaces: SDA1 and SCL1 are near to the AREF pin, and the additional interface is on pins 20 and 21.

As a reference, the table below shows where TWI pins are located on various Arduino boards.

|I2C/TWI pins 

|UNO, Ethernet 
|A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL)   

|Mega2560   
|20 (SDA), 21 (SCL) 

|Leonardo   
|20 (SDA), 21 (SCL), SDA1, SCL1
|=== 


As of Arduino 1.0, the library inherits from the Stream functions, making it consistent with other read/write libraries. Because of this, `send()` and `receive()` have been replaced with `read()` and `write()`.

Recent versions of the Wire library can use timeouts to prevent a lockup in the face of certain problems on the bus, but this is not yet enabled by default. It is recommended to always enable these timeouts when using the Wire library. See the Wire.setWireTimeout function for more details.

*Note:* There are both 7 and 8-bit versions of I2C addresses. 7 bits identify the device, and the eighth bit determines if it's being written to or read from. The Wire library uses 7 bit addresses throughout. If a datasheet or sample code uses 8-bit address, the low bit should be discarded by shifting the value one bit to the right, yielding an address between 0 and 127. Addresses from 0 to 7 are reserved and not used; the first address which can be used is 8. Please note that pull-up resistors are needed when connecting SDA/SCL pins. Please refer to the examples for more information. MEGA 2560 board has pull-up resistors on pins 20 and 21. 

*The Wire library implementation uses a 32 byte buffer; any communication should be maintained within this limit. bytes in a packet exceeding this length will be ignored.*

To use this library:

`#include <Wire.h>`
